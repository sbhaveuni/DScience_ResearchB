167,"Classify the type of adverse event as Death, Injury, or Device Malfunction.","A device was evaluated after being returned, and it was found that two locator wings were broken due to bending during thumb advancer deployment. The failure to fully collapse the wings into the delivery tube set resulted in difficult removal of the device. However, further analysis revealed that tissue compaction likely caused the damage to the wings by exerting a distal force on them while they were trapped between the tube set and locator wings. No manufacturing or quality issue was detected, and no similar issues were found in the device's history records for this lot.",Device Malfunction,"Classify the type of adverse event as Death, Injury, or Device Malfunction.
